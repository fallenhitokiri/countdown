not maintained - coding task for an interview.

# Task
Create a countdown timer that counts every second down to the end of 2016. At the end of 2016, the timer should stop, and the screen should alert the user "Happy New Year!".

Used to verify timer: [http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/multicountdown.html](http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/multicountdown.html)

Tested in:

- Safari Version 9.1.2 (11601.7.7)
- Chrome Version 52.0.2743.116 (64-bit)

## How much time you spent on the exercise
Roughly 35 minutes. (without writing this readme and getting the correct colours from the provided example image)

## Why you chose the tools you did
- jQuery: simple div selection / setting text. Could easily be replaced with plain JavaScript.

## What bugs / improvements you'd like to make in the code
- Consider making `countdown` a class (ask for ES5/6 compatibility first).
- Some warning when initialised with a date in the past.
- Update CSS to account for more than 4 digit numbers
